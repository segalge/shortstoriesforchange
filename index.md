  ## Short Stories for Change

# Do People Change?

This site is intended for the use of readers who want to understand how people change, as illustrated in classic short stories across cultures and across time.

Change is commonly understood as the result of 1) the process of growth and development or 2) spiritual awakening. The approach to short stories described here decidedly includes these two processes; however, because it was developed in a clinical setting, by a group of physicians, nurses, and healthcare managers, hosted by William Tucker, MD, it was originally intended to address challenges routinely encountered in clinical practice around health and lifestyle issues, where patients frequently fail at their peril to take charge of their health and illnesses. Change in this context—particularly when it is difficult to do or late in coming—means something larger as well: taking a step, large or small, in the direction of personal growth. Thus, we believe that our focus on change is applicable to other professional disciplines and in other settings, as well.
